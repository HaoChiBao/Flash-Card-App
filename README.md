This was a project made for the hackathon Deltahacks 9.

The project is a web app that allows users to create a profile and save flash cards to use for studying.

The idea was based around Quizlet, as we were trying to find a solution to make the app more interesting and fun to use.

Our intent was to make a web app that allowed users to play games with their flash cards, and to make the app more interactive.
